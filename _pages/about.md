Welcome!
======

Weitao Tang is a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence in Medical Technology at Monash University, Australia, supported by a joint scholarship from Monash University and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). His research focuses on biomedical signal processing and machine learning, with an emphasis on applying deep learning and transfer learning to fetal EEG, ECG, and EMG for sleep state classification and hypoxia–ischemia detection.

He works collaboratively across several institutions, including Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and is jointly supervised by:

Dr. Faezeh Marzbanrad — Monash University

Dr. Robert Galinsky — Hudson Institute of Medical Research & Monash University

Prof. Gari D. Clifford — Emory University & Georgia Institute of Technology

Dr. Nasim Katebi — Emory University

Together, this multidisciplinary team aims to advance AI-driven physiological monitoring, fetal neurodevelopment assessment, and early diagnosis in perinatal medicine.

Research Interests
------
- **Fetal and neonatal sleep state classification** using deep learning  
- **Multimodal physiological signal analysis** (EEG, ECG, EMG, Doppler, fetal movement)  
- **Transfer learning and cross-species/domain adaptation** for fetal–neonatal signal generalization  
- **Fetal hypoxia–ischemia detection** and early neurodevelopmental risk prediction  
- **Trustworthy and interpretable AI** for perinatal monitoring and medical decision support  
- **Representation learning** for biomedical time-series (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, contrastive learning)
