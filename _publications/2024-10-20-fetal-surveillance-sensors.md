Accurate detection of hypoxia during fetal monitoring is critical for timely intervention and prevention of brain injury. This study investigated hypoxia detection in fetal sheep by developing a classifier to differentiate between baseline, during acute hypoxia (umbilical cord occlusion; UCO), and post-hypoxia recovery (post-UCO), using physiological signals and an XGBoost machine learning model. A multi-modal approach integrating electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) signals was compared to a model based on the ECG signal only. We included recordings from 14 fetal sheep, each of which underwent acute hypoxia via a single UCO procedure. Performance of hypoxia detection was measured by Marco F1 score (F1 m), Accuracy (Acc), and standard deviation of validation error (SDE). Our multi-modal model achieved F1m= 0.88, Acc = 0.90, while the ECG-based approach achieved F1m = 0.82, Acc = 0.85. These results indicate that the multi-modal approach was superior to the ECG-only model for overall classification. While ECG and multimodal models correctly classified over 92% and 97% of acute hypoxia intervals, respectively, the classification of post- UCO intervals proved more challenging. The complexity of interpreting physiological signals underscores the need to consider temporal dynamics and physiological context in fetal monitoring.
